## Complete Model Code of Concrete Syntax Running Example
This part of the thesis supplemental material comprises the complete model code of the [food ordering case study microservice architecture](https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application) as included in the dissertation.

Furthermore, we provide the complete code of the derived intermediate models:
- The `intermediate` folder clusters the intermediate models for the modeling approach, which integrates technology information directly into service models. The complete intermediate models for the example intermediate models in the dissertation can be found in the following files:
  - Example intermediate domain model: `/intermediate/mapping models/Order/OrderDomain_Order.xmi`
  - Example intermediate service model: `/intermediate/service models/Order.xmi`
  - Example intermediate operation model: `/intermediate/operation models/Order.xmi`
- The `intermediate-alternative` folder comprises the intermediate models for the alternative approach to technology mapping, which shifts technology information from service to mapping models.
